            <p>Hello! My name is Dylan Bunker. I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV and that is where I still live. I have a dog named Laycee who I rescued 9 years ago and love more than anything! I enjoy spending time with my family and watching sports and I also collect hats, hat pins, and anime/comic figurines. I guess you can call me a nerd!🤣</p>

            <p>Las Vegas is the biggest city in the state of Nevada. It has been growing rapidly for the past 30 years and is now a premier destination for tourists. Vegas is now home to two professional sports teams, the Las Vegas Raiders and the Vegas Golden Knights, with more likely on the way. Even though Las Vegas is known as Sin City, the LDS community in Vegas is very large and very strong. It truly is a beautiful place to live!</p>
